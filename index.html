            <h3>Journey to the web development like sink in a deep sea  </h3>
            <p id="decription">Welcome to my personal portfolio website! My name is [Your Name] and I'm excited to share my journey with you.

                After completing my BSc degree, I discovered my passion for web development. I am now on a mission to become a professional web developer and take my skills to the next level.
                
            My journey has been challenging but rewarding, and I'm excited to see where it takes me. I have been learning and practicing various web development skills, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other frameworks and tools.
            
            <!-- I strongly believe that constant learning and practice are key to becoming a successful web developer. I'm constantly exploring new techniques, taking online courses, and building my own projects to improve my skills and knowledge.
            
            On this website, you'll find examples of my work and projects that I've created. I hope to showcase my skills and experience to potential employers and collaborators. I am excited to work with like-minded individuals and contribute to the ever-evolving field of web development.
            
            Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio website. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, feel free to reach out to me through the contact page. -->
